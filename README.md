# NFA to DFA automata conversion with epsilon closure
 
This proyect was made with the knowlegde acquired in the class of compilers and interpreters in the university

### Instalation

To run this app you will need to install React and run "npm start"

### Example

To convert this NFA:

You need to complete the form also don't forget to complete the start state and select your final state:

Once completed, check on "convert" button and will appear a table, this table is solution table:

Drawn as a DFA will appear something like this one:

For this example a have used a tool maded by Evan Wallace to show you the drawn NFA and DFA, here is the link to his page:
